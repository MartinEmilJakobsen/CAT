Description: The code takes an n x p data matrix and fits a Causal Additive Model (CAM) for estimating the causal structure of the underlying process. The output is a p x p adjacency matrix (a one in entry (i,j) indicates an edge from i to j). Details of the algorithm can be found in: P. BÃ¼hlmann, J. Peters, J. Ernest: "CAM: Causal Additive Models, high-dimensional order search and penalized regression", Annals of Statistics 42:2526-2556, 2014.
